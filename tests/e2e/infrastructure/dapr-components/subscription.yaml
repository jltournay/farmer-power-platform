# DAPR Pub/Sub Subscriptions Configuration
#
# Story 0.6.5: Plantation Model uses DAPR SDK streaming subscriptions (ADR-010/ADR-011)
# instead of declarative HTTP callback subscriptions.
#
# Streaming subscriptions are established programmatically in:
#   services/plantation-model/src/plantation_model/events/subscriber.py
#
# Topics subscribed via streaming:
#   - collection.quality_result.received (DLQ: events.dlq)
#   - weather.observation.updated (DLQ: events.dlq)
#
# The previous HTTP callback subscriptions (removed in Story 0.6.5):
#   /api/v1/events/quality-result → replaced by streaming handler
#   /api/v1/events/weather-updated → replaced by streaming handler
#
# Note: This file intentionally contains no declarative subscriptions.
# DAPR will not push events via HTTP; instead, the app pulls events via gRPC streaming.
