      "content": "# Blister Blight Disease Guide\n\n## Overview\n\nBlister blight (Exobasidium vexans) is one of the most serious fungal diseases affecting tea plants in East Africa. The disease primarily attacks young, actively growing tea leaves and shoots, causing significant yield losses if not properly managed.\n\n## Symptoms\n\nThe disease manifests as small, translucent spots on young leaves that enlarge into circular or irregular blister-like lesions. These blisters appear pale green to white on the upper leaf surface and have a velvety white appearance on the underside due to fungal spore production. Severely infected leaves become distorted, curl, and may fall prematurely.\n\n## Favorable Conditions\n\nBlister blight thrives in cool, humid conditions with temperatures between 15-20 degrees Celsius. The disease is most severe during the rainy season when relative humidity exceeds 80%. Morning mist and fog provide ideal conditions for spore germination and infection.\n\n## Management Strategies\n\n1. **Cultural Control**: Maintain proper plucking rounds to remove susceptible young shoots. Ensure good drainage and air circulation through proper spacing and pruning.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**: Apply copper-based fungicides preventively before rainy periods. Systemic fungicides may be used during active outbreaks following label recommendations.\n\n3. **Resistant Varieties**: Consider planting blister blight tolerant clones in highly susceptible areas.\n\n## Impact on Tea Quality\n\nInfected leaves produce bitter, astringent tea with poor liquor color. Severe infections can reduce yields by 30-50% during peak disease periods.",

      "content": "# Red Spider Mite Management\n\n## Identification\n\nRed spider mites (Oligonychus coffeae) are tiny arachnids that feed on tea leaves by piercing cells and sucking out contents. Adult mites are reddish-brown and barely visible to the naked eye. They produce fine silk webbing on leaf undersides.\n\n## Damage Symptoms\n\nInitial damage appears as bronzing or russeting on the upper leaf surface. Heavily infested leaves turn brown, become brittle, and may drop. The damage is most visible on mature leaves but affects overall plant vigor.\n\n## Population Dynamics\n\nMite populations explode during hot, dry weather. Peak infestations occur during drought stress when natural predators are reduced. A single female can produce 50-100 eggs, with populations doubling every 3-5 days under favorable conditions.\n\n## Integrated Pest Management\n\n1. **Monitoring**: Regular scouting using hand lens to detect early infestations. Economic threshold is 3-5 mites per leaf.\n\n2. **Biological Control**: Encourage predatory mites (Amblyseius species) by avoiding broad-spectrum pesticides. Maintain natural vegetation borders.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**: Proper irrigation during dry periods reduces plant stress. Adequate shade can reduce mite populations.\n\n4. **Chemical Control**: Use acaricides only when thresholds are exceeded. Rotate chemical classes to prevent resistance. Apply during cooler parts of the day.\n\n## Economic Impact\n\nUncontrolled mite infestations can reduce green leaf yields by 20-40% and significantly degrade made tea quality.",

      "content": "# Tea Plucking Standards and Techniques\n\n## Importance of Proper Plucking\n\nThe quality of made tea is fundamentally determined by the standard of plucking. Correct plucking ensures optimal balance between yield and quality while maintaining bush health and longevity.\n\n## Plucking Standards\n\n### Fine Plucking\nHarvest only the bud and two leaves (two-and-a-bud). This produces the highest quality tea but lowest yield. Recommended for premium CTC and orthodox production.\n\n### Coarse Plucking\nIncludes three or more leaves plus the bud. Higher yield but reduced quality. Acceptable only during peak flush periods when labor is limited.\n\n### Standard Plucking\nThe practical compromise harvesting the bud and two leaves with occasional three leaves. Maintains quality while achieving reasonable yields.\n\n## Plucking Technique\n\n1. Identify the plucking table - the uniform height of mature foliage\n2. Locate shoots extending above the table\n3. Break the stem cleanly between thumb and forefinger\n4. Place leaves gently into basket without crushing\n5. Avoid pulling or tearing which damages the bush\n\n## Plucking Rounds\n\nMaintain consistent plucking intervals based on growth rate:\n- Rainy season: 7-10 day rounds\n- Dry season: 10-14 day rounds\n- Cold weather: 14-21 day rounds\n\nShorter rounds produce finer tea; longer rounds increase coarse leaf percentage.\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n- Plucking below the table (damages bush frame)\n- Including fish leaves (reduces quality)\n- Crushing or compacting leaves in basket\n- Irregular plucking rounds allowing shoots to over-mature",

      "content": "# Nitrogen Fertilizer Application Guide\n\n## Role of Nitrogen in Tea\n\nNitrogen is the most critical nutrient for tea production. It promotes vegetative growth, increases leaf protein content, and directly influences yield. Tea plants require 200-300 kg N/ha/year for optimal production.\n\n## Application Timing\n\n### Split Applications\nDivide annual nitrogen into 3-4 applications aligned with rainfall patterns:\n\n1. **First Application** (January-February): 25% of annual dose before long rains\n2. **Second Application** (April-May): 35% during peak growing season\n3. **Third Application** (August-September): 25% before short rains\n4. **Fourth Application** (November): 15% if conditions permit\n\n### Weather Considerations\n- Apply when soil is moist but not waterlogged\n- Avoid application before heavy rainfall (leaching risk)\n- Do not apply during drought (poor uptake)\n\n## Fertilizer Sources\n\n| Source | N Content | Notes |\n|--------|-----------|-------|\n| Urea | 46% | Most economical, requires moist conditions |\n| CAN | 26% | More stable, good for dry conditions |\n| NPK 26:5:5 | 26% | Supplies additional P and K |\n| Ammonium Sulphate | 21% | Supplies sulfur, acidifies soil |\n\n## Application Method\n\nBroadcast fertilizer evenly around the drip line of bushes, avoiding contact with stems. Maintain 15-20 cm distance from bush collar. Apply in the morning when dew is present or before expected rainfall.\n\n## Signs of Deficiency\n\n- Pale green to yellow leaves\n- Reduced shoot growth\n- Smaller leaves than normal\n- Poor recovery after pruning\n\n## Over-application Risks\n\n- Increased pest and disease susceptibility\n- Reduced quality (excess chlorophyll)\n- Environmental pollution from runoff\n- Soil acidification over time",

      "content": "# Frost Damage Prevention and Recovery\n\n## Understanding Frost Risk\n\nTea plantations at elevations above 1800 meters are susceptible to frost damage during cold dry seasons. Frost occurs when ground-level temperatures drop below 0 degrees Celsius, typically during clear, calm nights between June and August.\n\n## Types of Frost\n\n### Radiation Frost\nMost common type caused by heat loss from ground on clear nights. Cold air pools in low-lying areas. Damage is localized and predictable.\n\n### Advection Frost\nCaused by cold air masses moving into the region. More widespread but less common. Difficult to protect against.\n\n## Damage Symptoms\n\nFrost-damaged leaves initially appear water-soaked and dark green. Within 24-48 hours, affected tissue turns brown or black. Buds and young shoots are most vulnerable. Severe frost can kill entire branches.\n\n## Prevention Methods\n\n### Site Selection\n- Avoid frost pockets and valley bottoms\n- Plant on slopes where cold air drains away\n- Establish windbreaks on cold air entry points\n\n### Active Protection\n- **Irrigation**: Sprinkler irrigation releases latent heat as water freezes\n- **Smoke/Fog**: Reduces radiation heat loss (limited effectiveness)\n- **Fans**: Circulate warmer air from above inversions\n\n### Passive Protection\n- Maintain good nutrition for cold tolerance\n- Avoid late pruning that stimulates tender growth\n- Mulching helps moderate soil temperature\n\n## Recovery After Frost\n\n1. Wait 7-10 days to assess full extent of damage\n2. Prune below damaged tissue to healthy wood\n3. Apply balanced fertilizer to promote recovery\n4. Resume normal plucking when new growth matures\n5. Monitor for secondary pest and disease problems\n\n## Economic Impact\n\nSevere frost events can destroy 30-50% of annual yield. Recovery typically takes 2-3 months.",

Understanding this relationship helps farmers plan operations and predict yields. Kenya's bimodal rainfall creates two peak production seasons.\n\n## Rainfall Requirements\n\nTea requires 1200-1400mm of well-distributed annual rainfall. Minimum monthly requirement is 100mm during growing season. Drought stress begins when soil moisture falls below field capacity for more than 2 weeks.\n\n## Seasonal Patterns in Kenya\n\n### Long Rains (March-May)\n- Peak production period (40-45% of annual crop)\n- Flush growth accelerates with rising temperatures\n- Plucking rounds shorten to 7-8 days\n- Quality can be lower due to rapid growth\n\n### Short Rains (October-December)\n- Secondary peak (25-30% of annual crop)\n- Generally higher quality due to slower growth\n- More consistent weather conditions\n- Labor planning critical for harvesting\n\n### Dry Seasons\n- January-February: Hot dry season, reduced yields\n- June-September: Cold dry season, lowest production\n- Yields may drop 50-70% compared to peak periods\n\n## Yield Prediction\n\nRainfall 2-4 weeks before harvest correlates strongly with green leaf production:\n\n| Rainfall (mm/week) | Expected Yield Impact |\n|-------------------|----------------------|\n| < 20 | 30-40% below normal |\n| 20-35 | 10-20% below normal |\n| 35-50 | Normal production |\n| 50-75 | 10-20% above normal |\n| > 75 | Quality concerns, normal yield |\n\n## Water Stress Indicators\n\n- Wilting of young shoots by mid-morning\n- Reduced internode length\n- Leaf curling and bronzing\n- Delayed bud break after plucking\n\n## Management Responses\n\n1. Extend plucking rounds during dry spells\n2. Reduce fertilizer rates when water limited\n3. Apply mulch to conserve soil moisture\n4. Consider supplementary irrigation if available",
