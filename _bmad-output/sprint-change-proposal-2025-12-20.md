# Sprint Change Proposal: Voice IVR System for Farmer Action Plan Delivery

**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Requested By:** Jeanlouistournay
**Priority:** MVP-Critical
**Status:** APPROVED

## Problem Statement

Farmers with basic phones and limited literacy cannot access detailed explanations of AI-generated action plans. The current communication channels have significant limitations:

- **SMS:** Limited to 160 characters - insufficient for detailed guidance
- **WhatsApp Audio:** Requires smartphones that most farmers don't have
- **Literacy Barrier:** Many farmers have low literacy and cannot read detailed text
- **Language:** Farmers speak local languages (Swahili, Kikuyu, Luo), not English

**Impact:** 800,000 smallholder farmers cannot receive detailed explanations of how to improve their tea quality, limiting the platform's core value proposition.

---

## Proposed Solution

Add a **Voice IVR Server** with **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** capability in local languages:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Inbound IVR** | Farmers dial a number to hear their latest action plan |
| **TTS Engine** | Converts action plan text to spoken audio |
| **Multi-Language** | Supports Swahili, Kikuyu, Luo |
| **SMS Handoff** | SMS includes "Call *XXX# for details" instruction |
| **Optional Callback** | Platform can call farmer to deliver guidance |

**User Flow:**
```
1. Farmer receives SMS: "Mama Wanjiku, chai yako: 4 stars. Piga *384# kwa maelezo zaidi"
2. Farmer dials *384# (or USSD code)
3. IVR greets in Swahili: "Habari Mama Wanjiku..."
4. TTS reads detailed action plan (2-3 minutes)
5. Farmer can replay or hang up
```

## Impact Analysis

### Epic Impact

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **New Epic Required** | "Voice IVR for Farmer Guidance" |
| **Priority** | MVP-Critical (Phase 1) |
| **Dependencies** | Notification Model, Action Plan Model |

**Proposed Epic Structure:**
- Voice Server infrastructure setup
- TTS engine integration (local languages)
- IVR call flow design (farmer calls in)
- Action Plan → Voice script conversion
- SMS → Voice handoff mechanism
- Multi-language voice selection
- Optional: Outbound callback system

### Artifact Changes

| Document | Impact Level | Changes Required |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Product Brief** | MEDIUM | Scope table, delivery channels, cost architecture, acceptance criteria |
| **Architecture** | HIGH | New Voice IVR Server component, TTS/IVR providers, notification model extension |
| **UX Design** | MEDIUM | Voice UX section, accessibility update, SMS→Voice handoff design |
| **Project Context** | LOW | Voice-related implementation rules |

---

## Recommended Approach

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Path Forward** | Direct Adjustment - update all documentation artifacts |
| **MVP Scope** | Expanded (no deferrals - keep all existing scope) |
| **Timeline Impact** | Acceptable - adding before implementation starts |
| **Risk Level** | Low - TTS and IVR are mature technologies |

**Rationale:**
- Clean addition before implementation begins
- Addresses core accessibility gap for 800K farmers
- TTS/IVR providers (Africa's Talking, Twilio) have proven Kenya support
- Aligns with platform's farmer-first value proposition

---

## Technology Recommendations

| Component | Recommended Provider | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **IVR/Voice** | Africa's Talking | Kenya-focused, USSD support, competitive pricing |
| **TTS Engine** | Google Cloud TTS or Amazon Polly | Swahili support, high quality |
| **Fallback** | Twilio | Global reliability if Africa's Talking unavailable |

**Cost Estimate (Monthly):**

| Item | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| TTS API calls | $500-1,000 |
| IVR/Voice minutes | $2,000-4,000 |
| **Total Voice** | ~$3,000-5,000/month |
