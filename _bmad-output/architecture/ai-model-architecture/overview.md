# Overview

The AI Model is the **6th Domain Model** - the centralized intelligence layer for the Farmer Power Cloud Platform. Unlike the previous design where AI agents were embedded in each domain model, all AI logic is centralized here.

**Core Responsibility:** Execute AI workflows (extraction, diagnosis, content generation) on behalf of other domain models.

**Does NOT:** Own business data, make business decisions about when to run, or store results persistently.
