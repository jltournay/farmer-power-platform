# Business Model Brainstorming Report

**Farmer Power Platform**

**Date:** 2025-12-17
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Method:** Six Thinking Hats + Value Chain Mapping
**Topic:** How to capture value created by quality improvement across the tea value chain

---

## Executive Summary

This brainstorming session explored business model options for the Farmer Power Platform, focusing on how to capture value from quality improvements across Kenya's tea value chain. Using the Six Thinking Hats methodology, we identified a critical insight: **the platform should sell VISIBILITY (measurement capability) rather than IMPROVEMENT (outcomes)**, and the initial funding may need to come from sources other than factories (grants, strategic partners, buyers).

**Key Finding:** The #1 blocker is hardware funding for the QC Analyzer. Everything else depends on solving this first.

## The Value Chain

```
FARMER → COLLECTION POINT → FACTORY → BUYER/EXPORTER → REGULATOR
(Wanjiku)    (Peter)         (Grace+Joseph)  (UK, etc.)    (Tea Board)
```

**Total Value at Stake:** $500 Million USD/year (with 20% quality improvement)
**Price Differential:** $2 USD/kg at Mombasa Auction between grades

## Six Hats Analysis

### WHITE HAT: Facts & Data

| Fact | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| $2 USD/kg price differential at auction | Significant financial incentive exists |
| $500M/year total value potential | Massive market if quality improves 20% |
| Factories have NO way to measure quality at intake | Gap in market - selling visibility |
| 800,000 smallholder farmers in Kenya | Scale is large |
| 100 factories in target market | Manageable initial market |
| UK stopped buying Kenya tea, shifted to Rwanda | Urgency - competitive threat |
| No way to precisely measure platform's contribution to improvement | Attribution problem |

**Key White Hat Insight:** The inability to measure quality at intake is the core problem. This reframes the value proposition from "improvement" to "visibility."

---

### RED HAT: Emotions & Intuitions

#### Core Fears Identified

1. **"We can't measure the value we create"**
   - Attribution is fuzzy (platform vs weather vs farmer skill)
   - No controlled experiment possible at scale
   - Improvement happens over months, hard to isolate cause

2. **"Even with proven value, nobody will want to pay"**
   - Everyone wants the benefit, nobody wants the bill
   - Classic "public good" problem

#### Willingness to Pay Assessment (Gut Feel)

| Actor | Will Pay? | Intuition |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Farmer | NO | Certain. Too poor, not the customer. |
| Factory | MAYBE | After 1+ year IF they see real improvement. Skeptical. |
| Buyer/Exporter | POSSIBLE | Interesting untapped opportunity |
| Regulator | DON'T COUNT ON IT | "This is Africa" - government payments slow/uncertain |

---

### YELLOW HAT: Benefits & Opportunities

#### Reframing the Value Proposition

| Old Framing | New Framing |
|-------------|-------------|
| "We improve tea quality" | "We let you SEE quality for the first time" |
| "Pay for better results" | "Pay to stop flying blind" |
| "Nice ROI over time" | "Win back UK market or lose it to Rwanda forever" |

#### Hidden Assets Being Built

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Quality-Outcome Dataset | 24+ months of farm-level data. Nobody else has this. |
| Farmer Registry | 800K verified farmers with contact info, location, history. Distribution channel. |
| Traceability Infrastructure | Farm-to-factory-to-auction chain of custody. Buyers demand this. |
| Behavioral Data | Which tips work? Which farmers respond? Predictive intelligence. |

#### The Rwanda Wake-Up Call

- UK buyers shifted to Rwanda for better quality
- Kenya has "bad quality" reputation
- This isn't about "improvement" - it's about SURVIVAL
- National competitiveness pitch, not startup pitch

#### Multiple Revenue Streams (Optimistic View)

1. **Factory Subscription** - Current model, reluctant payers
2. **Buyer Data License** - Traceability reports, ESG proof, quality certificates
3. **Grant Funding** - Bridge the proof gap
4. **Farmer Services Marketplace** - Inputs, credit, insurance (future)
5. **Export Certification** - "Farmer Power Certified" quality mark

### BLACK HAT: Risks & Critical Thinking

#### The Hardware Trap (Critical Risk)

```
You need HARDWARE to prove value.
Hardware needs MONEY to build.
Money needs PROOF to raise.
Proof needs HARDWARE.

= STUCK
```

#### Current Situation Assessment

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Funding | Family & Friends (limited runway) |
| QC Analyzer | Not built yet - needs funding |
| Pilot Site | Friendly factory available (positive) |
| Timeline | 12-18 months to prove value |

#### The Chicken-and-Egg Death Spiral

```
Factory: "Show me proof, then I'll pay"
    ↓
You: "I need money to build & operate to create proof"
    ↓
Factory: "Not my problem"
    ↓
You run out of money before proving value
```

#### Other Key Risks

- **Rwanda Already Won:** Is it too late to win back UK market?
- **Farmer Behavior:** What if farmers don't change despite receiving tips?
- **Factory Adoption:** Technology fear, change resistance, job protection concerns
- **Buyer Skepticism:** UK buyers will want certified, audited proof
- **Competition:** Big tech or Rwanda could build similar platform

### GREEN HAT: Creative Solutions

#### Direction 1: Alternative Funding Sources

| Source | Pitch Angle |
|--------|-------------|
| Ag-Tech Grants (Gates, USAID, World Bank) | "Farmer income improvement through tech" |
| Kenya-Specific (KCIC, Export Promotion) | "Win back UK market from Rwanda" |
| Tea Industry Bodies (KTDA, Tea Board) | "Industry-wide quality infrastructure" |
| Friendly Factory | Co-invest for equity or free subscription years |

#### Direction 2: Reduce Hardware Burden

- Partner with camera/AI hardware company (Sony, FLIR)
- University partnership for R&D
- Open-source hardware base (Raspberry Pi, Jetson)
- Minimum Viable Hardware (camera + laptop + manual process)
- Lease existing equipment and add AI layer

#### Direction 3: Shorten Proof Timeline

**Instead of proving "Quality improved 20% over 12 months"**

**Prove in 3 months:**
- "We can MEASURE quality at intake" (95% accuracy vs expert)
- "We can TRACE farm to factory"
- "Farmers RECEIVE and READ tips" (98% delivery)
- "Factory SEES their quality distribution" (dashboard)

#### Direction 4: Strategic Partnerships

| Partner | Why They Win If You Win |
|---------|------------------------|
| Big Tea Buyers (Unilever, Twinings) | ESG pressure, sustainable sourcing stories |
| Telecom (Safaricom) | Agri-tech success story, M-Pesa integration |
| Banks (Equity, KCB) | Farmer credit scoring from quality data |
| Input Suppliers | Marketing channel to 800K farmers |

#### Direction 5: The "Rwanda Threat" Pitch

> "Kenya lost the UK tea market to Rwanda. We can win it back. But we need to move NOW. Fund this pilot as national infrastructure, or watch Kenya tea become a commodity while Rwanda takes the premium."

This is a **national competitiveness** pitch, not a startup pitch.

### BLUE HAT: Synthesis & Next Steps

#### Key Insights

1. **Sell Visibility, Not Improvement** - Easier to prove, faster to demonstrate value
2. **Factory May Not Be First Payer** - Buyer, grant, or government might fund first
3. **Hardware Funding Is The Blocker** - Everything depends on solving this first
4. **Rwanda Is Your Best Sales Weapon** - National competitiveness creates urgency
5. **Minimum Viable Proof Can Be Faster** - 3 months for measurement proof vs 12 for improvement

#### Recommended Business Model (Phased)

**PHASE 1: PROVE (Month 0-12)**
- Funding: Grant + Strategic Partner + Factory co-invest
- Revenue: $0 (pilot is free)
- Goal: Working system + proof of measurement + early quality data

**PHASE 2: FIRST REVENUE (Month 12-24)**
- Funding: Seed investment (proof de-risks)
- Revenue: 5-10 factory subscriptions + buyer data license
- Goal: Prove willingness to pay + refine pricing

**PHASE 3: SCALE (Month 24+)**
- Funding: Series A
- Revenue: Factory subscriptions + Buyer licenses + Marketplace
- Goal: 50+ factories, expand to other crops/countries

## Appendix: Value Capture Framework

### Who Creates Value?

| Actor | Value Created |
|-------|---------------|
| Farmer | Improved quality leaves = less waste, premium grades |
| Collection Point | Traceability data linking farmer to bag |
| Factory | Objective quality data, processing optimization |
| Platform | Measurement, AI analysis, actionable insights |

### Who Captures Value?

| Actor | Current Capture | With Platform |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Farmer | Low - no feedback, no improvement path | Higher prices for better quality |
| Factory | Limited - waste, disputes | Reduced waste, premium output |
| Buyer | Limited - quality uncertainty | Traceability, quality assurance |
| Platform | $0 | 1-5% of value enabled |

### Value Capture Math

- Total value potential: $500M/year (at 20% quality improvement)
- Platform captures 1%: $5M/year revenue
- Platform captures 2%: $10M/year revenue
- Platform captures 5%: $25M/year revenue
