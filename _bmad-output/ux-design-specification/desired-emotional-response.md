2. **Reading Result:** Pride (WIN) or Understanding (WATCH/ACTION)
3. **Understanding Why:** Empowerment (leaf type explanation)
4. **Taking Action:** Hope (clear next step)
5. **Next Delivery:** Anticipation of improvement

**Joseph's Journey:**
1. **Dashboard Open:** Focused intention
2. **Priority Scan:** Clarity ("7 need attention")
3. **Farmer Selection:** Purpose (helping someone)
4. **Action Taken:** Accomplishment (assignment made)

4. **Monitoring:** Calm (health visible)

## Micro-Emotions by Interaction

| Interaction | Positive Target | Design Approach |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| SMS opens | Anticipation → Pride | Name first, visual indicator (✅/⚠️) |
| Dashboard loads | Clarity | Action-oriented categories, not raw data |
| Error occurs | Understanding | Explain why + what to do next |
| Config change | Confidence | Preview impact before commit |
| Empty state | Guidance | "Add your first..." not blank screen |
| Success moment | Accomplishment | Celebrate explicitly ("7 farmers improved!") |

## Design Implications

**To Create Pride (Farmers):**
- Always use preferred name ("Mama Wanjiku")
- Celebrate improvement trajectory ("Up from 72%!")
- Explain WHY in actionable terms (leaf type, not abstract quality)
- Never use language that implies blame

**To Create Clarity (Joseph):**
- One number per category (7 ACTION NEEDED, not scatter plot)
- Answer "what should I do?" in <5 seconds
- Hide complexity until needed (progressive disclosure)
- Action buttons always visible

**To Create Confidence (Admins):**
- Preview before commit (SMS template, price impact)
- Undo windows (7-day policy rollback)
- Validation feedback immediate (phone duplicate check)
- Status visible at all times (green/yellow/red)

## Emotional Design Principles

1. **Progress Over Perfection** - 65% → 78% is celebration-worthy, even if not yet 85%
2. **Names Build Trust** - "Mama Wanjiku" in every SMS = respect and recognition
3. **Action Beats Information** - "7 need help" trumps "Average: 74.2%"
4. **Transparency Creates Trust** - Show the leaf type breakdown, not just the score
5. **Forgiveness Reduces Fear** - Preview before commit, undo after action
6. **Celebrate Micro-Wins** - "Your advice helped 12 farmers improve this week"
