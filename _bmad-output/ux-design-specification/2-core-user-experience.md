# 2. Core User Experience

## 2.1 Defining Experience

**The Feedback Loop That Proves The System Works**

The defining experience of Farmer Power Platform is not a single screen or interaction—it's the complete feedback loop that transforms quality data into behavior change into measurable results. Users don't just receive information; they see proof that their actions create outcomes.

**The Loop:**
```
Quality Data → Personalized Coaching → Behavior Change → Better Quality → Better Price → Trust → More Engagement
```

**Why This Matters:**
The current tea supply chain has a broken feedback loop—information flows one way and stops. Farmers deliver, receive a price with no explanation, and have no improvement path. Farmer Power closes this loop by making every step visible and actionable.

**Primary Proof Point:** Factory-wide Premium % improvement since deployment. This is the north star metric that justifies the subscription and validates the entire system.

## 2.2 User Mental Model

**Factory Owner Mental Model:**
"I'm paying for results. Show me the ROI."
- Expects clear before/after comparison
- Wants proof the investment is paying off
- Needs ammunition for board/investor conversations

**Joseph (Quality Manager) Mental Model:**
"I need to see my interventions work."
- Currently flies blind—assigns extension officers but doesn't know impact
- Wants to feel effective, not just busy
- Expects cause-effect: "I acted → Things improved"

**Wanjiku (Farmer) Mental Model:**
"If I do X, I should see Y result."
- Familiar with agricultural cause-effect (plant → water → harvest)
- Current system gives no visibility into cause-effect for tea quality
- Needs to trust that improvement leads to better prices

**The Broken Loop (Current State):**
```
Farmer delivers → Gets same price as everyone → No explanation → No improvement → Loop stays open
```

**The Closed Loop (Farmer Power):**
```
Farmer delivers → Gets grade + explanation → Knows what to change → Improves → Gets better price → Trusts system → Engages more
```

## 2.3 Success Criteria

**The Cascade of Proof:**

| Level | User | Success Indicator | Proof Frequency |
|-------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **System** | Factory Owner | "Premium % up 18% since launch" | Monthly/Quarterly |
| **Intervention** | Joseph | "Farmers I assigned improved 12% vs 3% baseline" | Weekly |
| **Individual** | Wanjiku | "My Primary went 65% → 78% → 85%" | Per delivery |
| **Technical** | Platform | Traceable cause-effect attribution | Continuous |

**Emotional Target: Confidence & Trust**

The UX must feel like reliable instrumentation—"the data tells the truth, the system delivers." This means:
- Clean, consistent data visualization
- No hype or gamification gimmicks
- Metrics that match reality
- Attribution that's traceable and believable

**Success Indicators:**
- Factory Owner renews subscription based on visible ROI
- Joseph feels effective (interventions show measurable impact)
- Wanjiku trusts that improvement leads to better prices
- All users can answer "Is this working?" with data

## 2.4 Novel UX Patterns

**Established Patterns (Use As-Is):**
- ROI Dashboard: SaaS analytics dashboards are well-understood
- Before/After Comparison: "Since deployment" is standard
- Progressive Disclosure: Summary first, drill-down optional

**Novel Pattern: Multi-Level Attribution**

Most analytics show "here's your metric." Farmer Power must show "here's your metric AND here's WHY it changed AND here's WHO changed it."

**The Attribution Drill-Down:**
```
Factory Premium: 78% (+18% since launch)
                    ↓ click for attribution
"This improvement came from:"
├── 127 farmers moved from ACTION → WIN
├── Top contributor: Collection Point #3 (+25%)
├── Joseph's interventions: 89% success rate
└── Most improved: Wanjiku M. (58% → 91%)
```

**Why This Is Novel:**
- Connects individual farmer improvement to factory aggregate
- Shows the causal chain, not just the outcome
- Enables "who did this?" accountability
- Proves the system works, not just that metrics moved

```

**Design Principle:** Every screen, every message, every interaction must answer: "Is this working?" The answer should always be visible, data-driven, and trustworthy.
