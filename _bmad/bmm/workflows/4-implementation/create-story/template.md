# Story {{epic_num}}.{{story_num}}: {{story_title}}

**Status:** ready-for-dev
**GitHub Issue:** <!-- Auto-created by dev-story workflow -->

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a {{role}},
I want {{action}},
so that {{benefit}}.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [Add acceptance criteria from epics/PRD]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: #)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: #)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1

## E2E Story Checklist (MANDATORY for E2E stories)

**Read First:** `tests/e2e/E2E-TESTING-MENTAL-MODEL.md`

### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Read and understood `E2E-TESTING-MENTAL-MODEL.md`
- [ ] Understand: Proto = source of truth, tests verify (not define) behavior

### Before Starting Docker
- [ ] Validate seed data: `python tests/e2e/infrastructure/validate_seed_data.py`
- [ ] All seed files pass validation

### During Implementation
- [ ] If tests fail, investigate using the debugging checklist (not blindly modify code)
- [ ] If seed data needs changes, fix seed data (not production code)
- [ ] If production code has bugs, document each fix (see below)

### Production Code Changes (if any)
If you modified ANY production code (`services/`, `mcp-servers/`, `libs/`), document each change here:

| File:Lines | What Changed | Why (with evidence) | Type |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|------|
| (none) | | | |

**Rules:**
- "To pass tests" is NOT a valid reason
- Must reference proto line, API spec, or other evidence
- If you can't fill this out, you may not understand what you're changing

### Infrastructure/Integration Changes (if any)
If you modified mock servers, docker-compose, env vars, or seed data that affects service behavior:

| File | What Changed | Why | Impact |
|------|--------------|-----|--------|
| (none) | | | |

**Key insight:** If a change affects how production services BEHAVE (even via configuration), document it.

### Unit Test Changes (if any)
If you modified ANY unit test behavior, document here:

| Test File | Test Name Before | Test Name After | Behavior Change | Justification |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| (none) | | | | |

**Rules:**
- Changing "expect failure" to "expect success" REQUIRES justification
- Reference the AC, proto, or requirement that proves the new behavior is correct
- If you can't justify, the original test was probably right - investigate more

### Local Test Run Evidence (MANDATORY before any push)

**First run timestamp:** _______________

**Docker stack status:**
```
# Paste output of: docker compose -f tests/e2e/infrastructure/docker-compose.e2e.yaml ps
```

**Test run output:**
```
# Paste output of: pytest tests/e2e/scenarios/test_XX_*.py -v
# Must show: X passed, 0 failed
```

**If tests failed before passing, explain what you fixed:**

| Attempt | Failure | Root Cause | Fix Applied | Layer Fixed |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | | | | |

### Before Marking Done
- [ ] All tests pass locally with Docker infrastructure
- [ ] `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` pass
- [ ] CI pipeline is green
- [ ] If production code changed: Change log above is complete
- [ ] If unit tests changed: Change log above is complete
- [ ] Story file updated with completion notes
